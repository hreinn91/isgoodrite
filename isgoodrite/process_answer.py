Certainly! Let's go through the code and validate it step-by-step to ensure it meets your requirements.

The given Python code snippet defines a class `Solution` with a method `removeDuplicates` that removes duplicates from a list of integers. The method iterates over the input list, checks if each element is already in the set (which automatically handles duplicates), and if not, adds it to the set. Finally, it returns the size of the set, which represents the number of unique elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `removeDuplicates` takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer representing the number of unique elements in the list.

2. **Set Usage**: A set is used to store the elements of the list. Sets automatically handle duplicates, so if an element appears multiple times in the list, it will only be added once.

3. **Iteration and Check**: The function iterates over each element in the input list. For each element, it checks if the element is already in the set using the `in` keyword. If the element is not in the set, it adds it to the set.

4. **Return Value**: After iterating through all elements, the function returns the size of the set, which represents the number of unique elements.

5. **Main Function**: The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `removeDuplicates` method with a sample list `[3, 43, 2, 7]`.

Here's the complete code:

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Create an empty set to store unique elements
        unique_elements = set()
        
        # Iterate over each element in the input list
        for num in nums:
            # Check if the number is already in the set
            if num not in unique_elements:
                # If not, add it to the set
                unique_elements.add(num)
        
        # Return the size of the set, which represents the number of unique elements
        return len(unique_elements)


def main():
    l1 = [3, 43, 2, 7]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation:

- **Set Usage**: The `set()` function is used to create an empty set called `unique_elements`. This allows for efficient lookups and membership testing.
  
- **Iteration and Check**: The function iterates over each element in the input list `[3, 43, 2, 7]`. For each element, it checks if the element is already in the `unique_elements` set using the `in` keyword. If the element is not in the set, it adds it to the set.

- **Return Value**: After iterating through all elements, the function returns the size of the `unique_elements` set, which represents the number of unique elements in the list.

This code will correctly remove duplicates from the input list and return the count of unique elements.
